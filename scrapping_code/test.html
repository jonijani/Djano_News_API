The mass shooter is now in custody after he tried to outsmart cops by using a police scanner but within ten minutes of launching his spree he was tracked down. The killer left five men aged between 16 and 59 dead. The fifth victim wasn&#x27;t found until several hours after the shooting when an unnamed man returned home and found his 31-year-old son dead of multiple gunshots wounds. Two children, aged two and 13, were rushed to hospital but are in a stable condition, cops said. Families had been enjoying the July 4 festivities on the streets of the Kingsessing neighborhood when the gunman began opening fire at his unsuspecting victims. The shooter was quickly pursued and arrested by cops, who found the suspect was armed with an AR-style rifle, a handgun, and multiple magazines in his bullet proof vest. A second person who cops believe had &#x27;picked up the gun and returned fire in the direction of the shooter&#x27; was also in custody, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said late Monday night.&quot;,&quot;previewText&quot;:&quot;The 40-year-old suspect, who has not yet been named, began shooting at random as he stalked the streets of the largely residential neighborhood of Kingsessing for more victims to kill.&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;imageLargeDouble&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/04/14/72834771-0-image-a-15_1688477189377.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageLargePreview&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/04/14/72834771-0-image-a-14_1688477188074.jpg&quot;,&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/04/14/72834769-0-image-a-17_1688477190614.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_THUMB&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/04/14/72834771-0-image-a-14_1688477188074.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_LARGE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/04/14/72834771-0-image-a-15_1688477189377.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE LARGE DOUBLE&quot;}],&quot;fbShareCount&quot;:351,&quot;piShareCount&quot;:0,&quot;commentsCount&quot;:1330},{&quot;mobileGalleryCount&quot;:12,&quot;headline&quot;:&quot;Double child killer could stay behind bars: Parole Board is asked to reconsider its decision to allow Colin Pitchfork to be released from prison - after he was jailed for life for raping and strangling two 15-year-old girls&quot;,&quot;largeHeadline&quot;:&quot;Double child killer could stay behind bars: Parole Board is asked to reconsider its decision to allow Colin Pitchfork to be released from prison - after he was jailed for life for raping and strangling two 15-year-old girls&quot;,&quot;videoCount&quot;:2,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;GB&quot;,&quot;articleURL&quot;:&quot;/news/article-12259961/Lord-Chancellor-asks-Parole-Board-reconsider-decision-allow-Colin-Pitchfork-released.html&quot;,&quot;modifiedDate&quot;:&quot;2023-07-04T17:04:15+0100&quot;,&quot;articleId&quot;:12259961,&quot;socialHeadline&quot;:&quot;Parole Board asked to reconsider Colin Pitchfork release decision&quot;,&quot;authors&quot;:[&quot;Chris Matthews&quot;],&quot;firstPubDate&quot;:&quot;2023-07-03T18:28:01+0100&quot;,&quot;pageTitle&quot;:&quot;Parole Board asked to reconsider decision to release Colin Pitchfork&quot;,&quot;sponsoredArticle&quot;:null,&quot;largePreviewText&quot;:&quot;Double child killer Colin Pitchfork (pictured left and right) could stay behind bars after the Lord Chancellor asked the Parole Board to reconsider its decision to release him.

Peterson wept as the verdicts were read. The jury had deliberated for 19 hours over four days. The campus deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Peterson had been charged with failing to confront shooter Nikolas Cruz during his six-minute attack inside a three-story 1200 classroom building on February 14, 2018, that left 17 dead.

The brand-new lineup will also seen Ingraham, previously the host of the 10pm hour, kick off the primetime programming block at 7pm. Seasoned commentator Sean Hannity, meanwhile, will keep his old 9pm time, brass confirmed in a statement. The anticipated rearrangement comes almost two months to the day that Carlson was abruptly axed from his longtime post at Fox, days after it paid $787.5million to to settle a defamation suit linked to remarks made on the air by the commentator. In the time since, rumors swirled as to a possible replacement - with a frontrunner eventually surfacing in 44-year-old Watters, whose rise can be traced back to his days as a production assistant on the O&#x27;Reilly Factor when he was just 24, when he gained notoriety as a dogged man-on-the street correspondent. A combination of quippy, ambush-style interviews and charisma saw Watters&#x27; O&#x27;Reilly Segment, years later,  become a full-blown weekly series airing every Saturday, nearly a decade-and-a-half into his O&#x27;Reilly tenure. Carlson similarly rose through the ranks at Rupert Murdoch &#x27;s news station Before his firing, to become one of the highest-rated anchors on cable TV - before he was suddenly let go in April after a sterling 14 years. Suzanne Scott, the network&#x27;s CEO, announced Watters would be replacing Carlson in a statement early Monday morning.&quot;,&quot;previewText&quot;:&quot;Announced as part of a shuffle that will also see Laura Ingraham shift earlier in the evening and late-night host Greg Gutfeld move up to 10 pm, Watters&#x27; will now man the hallowed 8pm slot.&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;imageLargeDouble&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/26/18/72551159-0-image-a-8_1687799217844.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageLargePreview&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/26/18/72551159-0-image-a-7_1687799215776.jpg&quot;,&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/26/18/72551159-0-image-a-7_1687799215776.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_LARGE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/26/18/72551159-0-image-a-8_1687799217844.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE LARGE DOUBLE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/26/16/72547825-0-image-a-12_1687792991231.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_THUMB&quot;}],&quot;fbShareCount&quot;:278,&quot;piShareCount&quot;:0,&quot;commentsCount&quot;:769},{&quot;mobileGalleryCount&quot;:11,&quot;headline&quot;:&quot;Teenage mother sobs in the dock as she is jailed for a minimum of 12 years for murdering her newborn son by crushing his skull and stuffing cotton wool in his mouth after giving birth in silence because she was &#x27;anxious not to disturb her parents upstairs&#x27;&quot;,&quot;largeHeadline&quot;:&quot;Teenage mother sobs in the dock as she is jailed for a minimum of 12 years for murdering her newborn son by crushing his skull and stuffing cotton wool in his mouth after giving birth in silence because she was &#x27;anxious not to disturb her parents upstairs&#x27;&quot;,&quot;videoCount&quot;:0,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;GB&quot;,&quot;articleURL&quot;:&quot;/news/article-12235085/Teenage-mother-jailed-life-murdering-newborn-son-stuffing-cotton-wool-mouth.html&quot;,&quot;modifiedDate&quot;:&quot;2023-06-28T07:16:39+0100&quot;,&quot;articleId&quot;:12235085,&quot;socialHeadline&quot;:&quot;Teenage mother is jailed for life for murdering her newborn son&quot;,&quot;authors&quot;:[&quot;John James&quot;,&quot;Olivia Jones&quot;],&quot;firstPubDate&quot;:&quot;2023-06-26T16:23:29+0100&quot;,&quot;pageTitle&quot;:&quot;Teenage mother is jailed for life for murdering her newborn son by stuffing cotton wool in his mouth&quot;,&quot;sponsoredArticle&quot;:null,&quot;largePreviewText&quot;:&quot;A teenage girl who murdered her newborn son at her parents&#x27; house when she was just 15 has today been jailed for life with a minimum of 12 years.

The 1958 say they will be at the Old Trafford store on Tuesday morning, to coincide with the launch of United&#x27;s new adidas kits. Large sections of the club&#x27;s support are furious with the Glazers, with the process now in its eighth month having launched last November.

The £65m price tag is a figure that Erik ten Hag&#x27;s (centre) side believe is too high for Mount, who has just one year left on his contract and will be available for nothing next summer - unless he signs a new contract at Stamford Bridge. They consider £55m for the England international to be more than a fair offer so will leave it on the table and explore a deal for Caicedo (left).
